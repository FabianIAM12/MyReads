# MyReads Project - React

This is a react project as part of the Udacity's FrontEnd Nanodegree course. 

In the MyReads project, i created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books.
The books are divided into have read, currently reading or want to read. Another functionality it to search and add other books as well.

## Installing

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Acknowledgments
The programming with React was funny and showed me the power of that awesome JavaScript-Framework.
